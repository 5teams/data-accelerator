Unleash the full power of [Data Accelerator](Data-accelerator) by deploying it into your subscription in Azure by following the instructions below and get started setting up end to end data pipelines! 

# Prerequisites
 - Install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
 - Download the scripts and templates via [this link](https://github.com/Microsoft/data-accelerator/tree/stable/DeploymentCloud)

# Deployment
The deployment scripts require a minimum of configurations before launching the steps to set up the environment.  You can do so by following these steps:
 - Open common.parameters.txt under Deployment.DataX and provide TenantId and SubscriptionId.  See [Configuring the ARM template](https://github.com/Microsoft/data-accelerator/wiki/Configuring-the-Arm-template) for more options.
 - On Windows OS, open a command prompt as an admin and run the following under Deployment.DataX
```
Deploy.bat
```
 - If you are not an admin of the subscription, youâ€™ll need to ask the admin to run the following along with the parameter file adminsteps.parameters.txt from under Deployment.DataX to finish setting up.
```
adminSteps.ps1
```
Once the deployment finishes, the Data Accelerator portal should open (or you can navigate to http://name.azurewebsites.net where the name will be displayed at the end of the script or can be obtained from the deployed App Service on the http://portal.azure.com)
